### Client Setup (`a11-food-sharing-client`)

1.  Navigate to the `a11-food-sharing-client` directory.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Create a `.env` file in the root of the client directory and add your Firebase configuration:
    ```env
    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
    VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
    VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
    ```
4.  Start the development server: `npm run dev`

### Server Setup (`a11-food-sharing-server`)

1.  Navigate to the `a11-food-sharing-server` directory.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Create a `.env` file in the root of the server directory:
    ```env
    PORT=3000
    DB_USER=your_mongodb_username
    DB_PASS=your_mongodb_password
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
    # Add your MongoDB connection string if not using user/pass directly in URI
    # MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster....
    ```
4.  Download your Firebase Admin SDK JSON key file, rename it to `firebase-admin-sdk.json`, and place it in the root of the `a11-food-sharing-server` directory. **Ensure this file is added to your `.gitignore`**.
5.  Start the server: `npm start` (or `nodemon index.js` if you have nodemon installed for development).
